# Itim Font

Itim is a Looped Thai and Latin Handwriting typeface that has a rounded tip marker stroke. With its fun and friendly style, Itim is suitable to use as headline and short body text in various type of works such as children's book, picture book, cooking book, and instructional media in school etc. It has 3 stylistic set alternate glyph designs and intelligent OpenType features to recreate the impression of handwriting with fun and friendly voice. It also has Latin 1 - 4 including Vietnam glyphs.

Itim is how Thai people call "ice pop".

Thanks to Pablo Impallari for the initial OpenType handwriting feature development.
The Itim project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/itim
